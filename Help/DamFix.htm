		<P></P>
		<P>The purpose of the application is to alter the Telescope database to reflect 
			changes in the physical asset location&nbsp;represented by&nbsp;filebroker 
			location, filebroker name, disk label or server name within the <STRONG><EM>DOC_RENDITIONS</EM></STRONG>
			table for the <STRONG><EM>FILE_LOCATION</EM></STRONG> and <EM><STRONG>LONG_NAME</STRONG></EM>
			column fields.
		</P>
		<P>The main dialog window looks like this;</P>
		<P align="center"><IMG alt="damfix.jpg" src="damfix.jpg" align="middle"></P>
		<P>There are five (5) sections within the dialog, File Location, Long Name, Root 
			Folder, Server and Database. Each section will be covered seperatley.</P>
		<P><STRONG><FONT size="4">File Location.<BR>
				</FONT></STRONG>This section effect the <STRONG><EM>FILE_LOCATION</EM></STRONG>
			column within the <EM><STRONG>DOC_RENDITIONS</STRONG></EM> table of Telescope. 
			The "<EM>Label</EM>" entries refer to Disk Label, and "<EM>FB</EM>" entries 
			refer to File Broker name. The <EM>Old Label</EM> and <EM>Old FB</EM> are used 
			for location of records, and are only updated if new entries are provided under <EM>
				New Label</EM> or <EM>New FB</EM>. These can be updated independatley of 
			each other if required. The <EM><STRONG>FILE_LOCATION</STRONG></EM> column is 
			used by the filebroker to locate and download the asset to the user. If this 
			field is incorrect the asset will be <FONT color="#ff0066"><U><STRONG>unavailable for 
						download</STRONG></U></FONT>, only visable as metadata and 
			thumbnail entry within Telescope. If assets need to be moved to a different 
			physical location for space considerations, this field will have to be modified 
			to enable assets to be available from the new location.</P>
		<P><STRONG><FONT size="4">Long Name.<BR>
				</FONT></STRONG>This section effect the LONG_NAME column within the <EM><STRONG>DOC_RENDITIONS</STRONG></EM>
			table of Telescope. The "<EM>Label</EM>" entries refer to Disk Label, and "<EM>FB</EM>" 
			entries refer to File Broker name. The <EM>Old Label</EM> and <EM>Old FB</EM> are 
			used for location of records, and are only updated if new entries are provided 
			under <EM>New Label</EM> or <EM>New FB</EM>. These can be updated independatley 
			of each other if required. The <EM><STRONG>LONG_NAME</STRONG></EM> column is 
			used for visual presentation of the asset location to the end user, and will 
			not have any effect on the availability of the asset if not set to the correct 
			location. It will however cause confusion to some users and any IT staff using 
			this as a reference, so keeping in sync with the correct location is advised.</P>
		<P><STRONG><FONT size="4">Root Folder.</FONT></STRONG><BR>
			This is an optional field. It only needs to be used if a <EM>single</EM> top 
			level folder <EM>under</EM> a filebroker is desired to be moved, and specifies 
			the folder name. In the example image above only the Fall season tree would be 
			moved. This is a special use condition that is not a normal operation.
		</P>
		<P><STRONG><FONT size="4">Server.</FONT></STRONG><BR>
			This is an optional field. It only is used to change the server of the file 
			store that the asset resides on. Typically only used on the development system 
			to reassign production assets.</P>
		<P><STRONG><FONT size="4">Database.<BR>
				</FONT></STRONG>Requred field. This dropdown will present a list of 
			registered TNS names from the oracle <EM>tnsnames.ora</EM> file on the machine 
			that is running the application. Selection of the correct database 
			configuration is required, and also allows for updates to be run from a remote 
			machine with appropiate configuration settings.</P>
